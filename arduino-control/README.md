# Arduino Control

This is an Archived Version for my UCSC Capstone Project, the Crop Doctor. Code here is code I've written.

'Libraries' folder contains developed libraries for Arduino code.

'Primary Sketch' folder contains the main operating loop.


'Test Sketches' are primarily testing harnesses and older prototypes for different iterations of the main operating loop and some library functions.
